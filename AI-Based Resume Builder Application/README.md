## ðŸ›  Problems and Solutions

### **Issue 01: Next.js 15 Typed Routes Bug**

**Problem:**  
While upgrading my full-stack AI Resume Builder to Next.js 15 (App Router), I encountered a critical TypeScript error during production builds. Despite correctly typing dynamic route params and trying all recommended fixes (typedRoutes config, generateStaticParams, async/await adjustments), the build kept failing with:

```
Type '{ params: { id: string } }' does not satisfy the constraint 'PageProps'.
Type '{ id: string }' is missing the following properties from type 'Promise<any>': then, catch, finally, [Symbol.toStringTag]
```

The root cause was Next.js 15â€™s experimental typed routes feature. It enforced strict type checking on dynamic route parameters in a way that was broken for some cases, expecting params to behave like Promises unnecessarily.

**Solution:**

- Downgraded from Next.js 15 to 14.2.x for stability.
- Adjusted minor configurations in next.config.js and font imports.
- Production builds ran successfully, and the app now works flawlessly.

### **Issue 02: Mobile Print Styles Showing Instead of Desktop Styles**

**Problem:**
After making the resume responsive for mobile, printing the resume caused it to use mobile-optimized styles (stacked layouts, centered text) instead of the cleaner desktop layout. This resulted in unprofessional print output, as desktop styles (side-by-side sections, proper alignment) are much better for printed resumes.

**Solution:**

- Leveraged Tailwind CSSâ€™s `print:` modifier to enforce desktop-specific styles during printing.
- Updated the layout code:

`Before (Problematic Code):`

```
<div className="flex flex-col lg:flex-row">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```

Printed layout: `flex-col` (mobile stacked layout)

`After (Fixed Code):`

```
<div className="flex flex-col lg:flex-row print:!flex-row">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```

### **Issue 03: Managing Reusable Styles in Tailwind CSS**

**Problem:**
While building the appâ€™s design, I felt exhausted from repeatedly writing the same Tailwind utility classes across multiple components. This repetition made the JSX messy and harder to maintain.

**Solution:**

- Used Tailwind CSSâ€™s @apply directive inside globals.css to create reusable, clean styles.
- Example: instead of repeating className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg shadow", I defined a reusable class in CSS:

```
.card {
  @apply bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg shadow;
}
```

Now components can simply use `className="card"`.

`Benefits:`

- Avoids repeating utility classes (DRY principle)
- Easier to maintain and update styles globally
- Cleaner JSX, making the project more organized and maintainable

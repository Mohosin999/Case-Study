## ðŸ›  Problems and Solutions

### **Issue 01: Low-Resolution Playlist Thumbnails**

**Problem:**  
The playlist thumbnails displayed in low resolution, affecting the visual quality.

**Solution:**  
Replaced the default playlist thumbnail with the thumbnail of the first item in the playlist, which is of higher resolution, ensuring better visuals.

### **Issue 02: Duplicate Success Messages When Adding a Playlist**

**Problem:**  
A success message appeared twice:

- Before the playlist was fetched.
- After the playlist was successfully displayed.

**Solution:**  
Implemented `async/await` in the handler function to ensure the success message is displayed only after the playlist fetch operation is completed.

### **Issue 03: Excessive API Calls on Playlist Page Visits**

**Problem:**  
Each visit to the playlist page triggered an API call to fetch data, leading to slower performance and unnecessary server load.

**Solution:**  
Cached fetched playlist data in local storage on the first visit. Subsequent visits load the data from local storage, significantly reducing API calls and improving performance.
